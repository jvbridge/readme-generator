# readme-generator
a Readme generator using Node.js

This profram will prompt the user for a few inputs before generating a README
file with the name `GENERATED.md` so as not to over write any file you might 
already have that's named `README.md`

Here's a brief demonstration

## Contributing
This project is fairly small and so contribuing is not neccessary so far. 

If you do wish to contribute to it, feel free to fork the repository and use it
for your personal use, just make sure that it retains the MIT license

## Tests
The testing done to ensure this works was to create this very README with it!

I cheated a little bit by implementing file imports, but there's no reason that
another person couldn't do exactly the same thing with it.
